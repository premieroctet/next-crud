# Adapters

An adapter is a class implementing various methods allowing you to query the data to the database your app uses.

Out of the box, `next-crud` provides an adapter for [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/), but it is easy to create your own one. Your adapter must follow the following interface:

```typescript
export interface IAdapter<
  T,
  Q = IParsedQueryParams,
  M extends string = string
> {
  models: M[]
  parseQuery(resourceName: M, query?: IParsedQueryParams): Q
  getAll(resourceName: M, query?: Q): Promise<T> // GET /api/resourceName
  getPaginationData(resourceName: M, query: Q): Promise<TPaginationData> // Used for pagination
  getOne(resourceName: M, resourceId: string | number, query?: Q): Promise<T> // GET /api/resourceName/:id
  create(resourceName: M, data: any, query?: Q): Promise<T> // POST /api/resourceName
  update(
    resourceName: M,
    resourceId: string | number,
    data: any,
    query?: Q
  ): Promise<T> // PUT/PATCH /api/resourceName/:id
  delete(resourceName: M, resourceId: string | number, query?: Q): Promise<T> // DELETE /api/resourceName/:id
  connect?: () => Promise<void> // connect function to your DB
  disconnect?: () => Promise<void> // disconnect function to your DB
  handleError?: (err: Error) => void // Used to throw a custom error of your own
  getModels(): M[]
  getModelsJsonSchema?: () => any // JSON Schema of your models, used for Swagger
  mapModelsToRouteNames?: () => { [key in M]?: string } // Object associating the model name with a route name
}
```

The `parseQuery` function is used to transform out basic query parsing into a shape that your database would expect. If you don't need that kind of transformation, your function can just return the `query` argument, which has the following properties:

#### select

An object with either boolean values or nested objects for nested fields.

Example:

```javascript
{
  user: true,
  articles: {
    user: true
  }
}
```

#### includes

Same as [select](#select)

#### where

An object obtained by applying `JSON.parse` on the associated <Link href="/query-params#where">query param</Link>

#### orderBy

An object obtained by applying `JSON.parse` on the associated <Link href="/query-params#orderby">query param</Link>

#### limit

A number

#### skip

A number

#### distinct

A string

Additionally, you will receive the potential query params that has not been parsed.

## Prisma adapter

### Options

The `PrismaAdapter` class can be instantiated with the following options

#### models

An optional array of the Prisma models you want to support. By default it takes the model names stored in the Prisma client. You can customise that behavior using the `models` configuration option of the `NextCrud` function.

#### primaryKey

The name of the key used to retrieve the your unique resources. Defaults to `id`.

#### prismaClient

An instance of your Prisma client.

### manyRelations

An object of arrays containing all the relations and nested relations of your model that could be queried from the `where` filter. For nested relations, split them with a `.`, e.g: `posts.author`
The keys of the object must correspond to the models names.

Example:

```typescript
new PrismaAdapter<User | Post, ModelName>({
  prismaClient: myPrismaClient,
  manyRelations: {
    User: ['posts'],
  },
})
```

---

### Additional query params

The Prisma adapter allows you to use an additional query param, which is related to a property used by prisma:

#### cursor

A JSON object containing only 1 key and a matching value corresponding to an entry in the database which is the starting point of the result of the query. You can see that as an offset.

Example :

```
/api/users?cursor={"id":1}
```
