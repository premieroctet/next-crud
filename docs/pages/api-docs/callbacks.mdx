# Callbacks

Callbacks are functions executed in 3 different situations:

#### onRequest

A request has arrived and the callback is executed right before any action on the database. It receives 4 arguments: the request, the response, an object containing the route type, the resource id and the resource name.
You can use it to add some custom content to your query params for example, or to just do some debug.

#### onSuccess

The request is successful and the callback is executed right before ending the handler. It receives 2 arguments: the request and the response.

#### onError

The request is unsuccessful and the callback is executed on the first error it meets. It receives 3 arguments: the request, the response and the thrown error.
A simple use case would be to notify some error monitoring system like Bugsnag.
