# Middlewares

Middlewares are executed right after your data has been retrieved from the database. They are functions that accepts the following arguments:

- context as the first argument. It's an object will the following shape:

```typescript
export type TMiddlewareContext<T> = {
  req: NextApiRequest
  res: NextApiResponse
  result: T | T[] // the data retrieved from the database
}
```

- a function as the second argument, which is used to execute the next middleware in the stack.

<Callout emoji="⚠️">
  The request response is done by a middleware which is added by default at the
  end of the middlewares stack. So it is mandatory that you call the function
  received as your second argument, or your request will end up with no data
  inside.
</Callout>

You can use middlewares to play with your data, for example if you want to wrap your data in a specific key you'd do the following:

```javascript
middlewares: [
  (ctx, next) => {
    ctx.result = {
      myCustomKey: ctx.result,
    }
    next()
  },
]
```

_Note: the following won't work, because you need to mutate directly the context object_

```javascript
middlewares: [
  ({ result }, next) => {
    result = {
      myCustomKey: result,
    }
    next()
  },
]
```
