import Link from 'next/link'

# Installation

`yarn add @premieroctet/next-crud`

or

`npm i -S @premieroctet/next-crud`

---

# Usage

- Create a file under `pages/api/<modelName>` called `[[...someName]].ts`. You can also have 2 files called `index.ts` and `[id].ts` under that folder, both files will have to contain the same content.

- Import the handler and the adapter you want to use, in that case we will use the prisma adapter but you can use your own one (see <Link href="/api-docs/adapters">this section</Link>)

```javascript
import NextCrud, { PrismaAdapter } from '@premieroctet/next-crud'
```

- Then create the handler and export it

```javascript
const handler = NextCrud({
  resourceName: modelName, // the model which corresponds to the folder name
  adapter: new PrismaAdapter({
    modelName: 'user',
  }),
})

export default handler
```

You can then try a simple request using a tool like Postman, Insomnia or just your web browser. Start your Next.js app, then go to `http://localhost:3000/api/<yourModelName>`, which should return a json containing a list of data from your resource.
