# Query params

You can add some criteria to your queries using the query params. Here is the list of the supported query params:

#### select

A list of fields which will be retrieved to the model. You can select nested fields by just separating the fields with a `.`. Example:

```
select=id,username,articles,articles.id
```

will return a response with the following shape

```
{
  id: 'something',
  username: 'something',
  articles: [
    {
      id: 'something'
    }
  ]
}
```

#### include

A list of fields which corresponds to the model relations to include. You can aswell include nested fields just like you would do with `select`

#### where

A JSON representation of the search conditions, heavily inspired on what [nest-crud](https://github.com/nestjsx/crud/wiki/Requests#search) does. It supports the following operators:

- `$eq` (`=`, equal)
- `$neq` (`!=`, not equal)
- `$in` (`IN`, in range, must be an array)
- `$nin` (`NOT IN`, not in range, must be an array)
- `$lt` (`<`, lower than, must be a numeric value)
- `$lte` (`<=`, lower than or equal, must be a numeric value)
- `$gt` (`>`, greater than, must be a numeric value)
- `$gte` (`>=`, greater than or equal, must be a numeric value)
- `$cont` (`LIKE %val%`, contains string value)
- `$starts` (`LIKE val%`, field starts with value)
- `$ends` (`LIKE %val`, field ends with value)
- `$isnull`, (`IS NULL`, must be used in a string, e.g: `"myfield": "$isnull"`)

We also provide 3 operators to combine multiple search:

- `$and` (`AND`), should be an object, this is the same thing as just providing an JSON object to the query param
- `$or` (`OR`), should be an object, this will apply an `OR` condition between each properties of the object
- `$not` (`NOT`), should be an object, this should match all the data in the database that do not match those criteria.

#### orderBy

A JSON representation of the field to order by and its direction. This should be an object containing only 1 key (name of the field to order by) with a valid order operator. These are the 2 available operators:

- `$asc` for ascending order
- `$desc` for descending order

#### limit

A number representing the number of element to return

#### skip

The number of element to skip the first n elements from the query

#### distinct

A field name on which the duplicates are removed from the dataset
